# accurate-and-robust-saliency-
The aim is to design a simple yet powerful deep network architecture U2-net,for saliency detection. U2-Net architecture allows the network to go deeper,attain high resolution,without significantly increasing the memory and computational cost. This is achieved by a nested U-structure. On the bottom level,with a residual U-block and on the top level,there is a U-Net like structure,in which each stage is filled by a RSU block.
